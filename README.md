# Interactive: How Accurately Can You Guess India's Press Freedom Trajectory Since Modi Became PM in 2014?

For this project, I learned how to create you-draw-it interactive graphs, where the user is given the option to complete or draw the rest of a graph, after which the correct graph is displayed. 

I chose to do this project on how India has fared on press freedom under Prime Minister Narendra Modi since 2014 since the country is in the midst of an all-important parliamentary election right now. 

I had been interested in making this kind of you-draw-it graph earlier as well, but thought I would need a paid Flourish plan to be able to make one. It was therefore great to be able to figure out how to do this myself.

I used a helpful you-draw-it guide by journalist Erin Petenko in order to make the chart.

There were one major challenge during the process - the result that pops up in text below the graph shows what the user's answer was for a particular year. However, there was a problem in aligning what the user drew on the graph with the number that showed up in text below the graph.
